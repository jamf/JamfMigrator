# Jamf Migrator

Current release Download: [Jamf Migrator](https://github.com/jamf/JamfMigrator/releases/latest/download/jamf-migrator.zip)

A tool to migrate data granularly between Jamf Pro servers

![alt text](./jamf-migrator/images/migrator2.png "JamfMigrator")


Migrate items from one Jamf server, or XML file(s), to another.  If an item (based on name) within a category exists on both source and destination, the destination item will be updated with values from the source server.

  Groups, Policies, and Configuration Profiles can be targeted to a particular site.
  ![alt text](./jamf-migrator/images/migrator2.5b.png "Files")

Feedback in the GUI gives a simplistic overview of the success of a transfer:
* Green - everything transferred.
* Yellow - some items transferred.
* Red - nothing transferred.
* White - nothing to transfer.

   You may see a difference between the color of the text and the progress bar.  This is an indication some dependency was missing.  For example a script migrated but the category it was associated with on the source server is missing on the destination server.


**Limitations/requirements to be aware of:**

* Passwords can not be extracted through the API which impacts migrating distribution points, computer management account, account used for LDAP.  A password can be supplied for each service account, but credentials may need to be reset on the destination server for more complex configurations.
* Certificate used for LDAPS does not migrate.
* Icons associated with Mac App Store apps are not migrated as the API does not support it.
* Only AFP and SMB shares can be migrated.
* Patch management is not available through the API impacting smart groups dependent on patch management extension attributes.
* If endpoints (computers, policies, configuration profiles...) have duplicate names on the source server issues will arise if the app is used to update those items from the source to destination server.  As each item is migrited it will overwrite the previous item with the same name.
* Migrating smart/static groups with criteria containing groups will fail if the parent group tries to migrate before the group in the criteria.  Migrating groups several times should allow all the nested groups to migrate before the parent group.
* Institutional disk encryptions that contain the private key cannot be migrated.
* Approved Kernel Extension payloads do not migrate properly.  Display names are dropped and additional keys/values are added by the Jamf API that results in a corrupt profile and failure in profile deployment.
* System Extensions do not migrate properly.  They may appear to migrate but fail when being deployed.
* Policies - The Software Update payload does not migrate.  Also, within the packages payload, setting for the distribution point will not migrate.
* Objects with trailing spaces in the name will migrate once but the process of uploading through the API removes those spaces.  This causes issues re-migrating those objects as the names no longer match.
* Packages <ul>
  <li>Only package metadata (display name, file name, size, ...) are migrated.  To migrate the actual package either use your browser, Jamf Admin, or [jamfcpr](https://github.com/BIG-RAT/jamfcpr)</li>
  <li>The API allows for the creation of multiple packages, with different display names, to reference the same package file name.  The Jamf Pro console prevents this as there should be a one to one mapping.</li>
  </ul>
* Saving of objects whos name contains a : (colon) will be saved using a ; (semi-colon).
* Enabled state of mobile device applications is not handled in the API, as a result all migrated mobile device applications will be enabled on the destination server whether it is enabled or disabled on the source.

The 'Selective' tab provides the ability to select a subset of items within a category.  For example you might only want to transfer 4 new scripts from a larger pool of existing scripts.
  ![alt text](./jamf-migrator/images/migrator3.png "Selective")
  
Note: Policies are listed along with the their ID.  They'll be listed with a format of: policy name (ID)

Also, policies may have their dependencies checked/migrated using the Migrate Dependencies button.  Only 'top-level' dependencies are checked.  i.e. if the scope is being migrated and contains nested computer groups or groups assigned to a site that doesn't exist on the destination server the policy migration will likely fail.  Adding smart migrations is planned for other items.
![alt text](./jamf-migrator/images/migrator3Policies.png "Selective")


When importing XML files they must be organized into folders that, for the most part, mirror their respective API nodes. i.e. computer XML files in a folder labeled computers, mobile devices in a folder called mobiledevices. Exceptions to this are group items, for example computer groups are split into a smartcomputergroups folder and staticcomputergroups folder. This is also how jamf-migrator exports files. Then when importing, select the folder that contains the API nodes we wish to update. For example, if selecting files generated by exporting data with jamf-migrator we would select the folder called raw.

![alt text](./jamf-migrator/images/open.png "Open")
  
**Important:** Trimmed XML files cannot be used as they are missing data required for the migration. 

**Command Line Options:**

Options for setting an ldap id on jamf user accounts and/or converting standard accounts to ldap accounts can be accomplished by launching jamf-migrator from Terminal.  For example to set an ldap id of 3 and force that id (even on local accounts) use the following:
```
~/jamf-migrator.app/Contents/MacOS/jamf-migrator -ldapid 3 -forceldapid true
```


**Preferences:**

* macOS Configuration Profiles 
* macOS Applications 
* Restrictions 
* Policies 
* Mobile Device Configuration Profiles 
* Mobile Device Applications 
* Static Computer Groups 
* Static Mobile Device Groups 
* Static User Groups 

In addition, Policies can be copied in a disabled state.

![](./jamf-migrator/images/copyPrefs.png)

Options to export XML from the source server are also available.

![](./jamf-migrator/images/exportPrefs.png)

* Raw Source XML gives you the XML from the source server before any modifications, like removing the id tag(s) and value(s).
* Trimmed Source XML give you the XML that is sent to the destination server.
* Save only saves the XML files and does not send them to the destination server.
* Save the object XML either with or without its scope.  Unchecked removes the scope.
* Note Save only and Raw Source XML options should not be selected when File Import is being used.

Options for migrating object(s) (groups, policies, and configuration profiles) to a particular site can be set.

![](./jamf-migrator/images/sitePrefs.png)

* When copying an object to a site, the site name is appended to the object name.
* Groups with groups as a criteria will not copy properly, moving them should be fine.

The number of concurrent API operations (from 1 to 5) and number of log files to retain can be configured.

![](./jamf-migrator/images/appPrefs.png)

Migrated computers can show as managed by setting the management account.

![](./jamf-migrator/images/computerPrefs.png)

Set a password for following migrated service accounts; bind, ldap, file share Read/Write, and file share Read-only.

![](h./jamf-migrator/images/passwordPrefs.png)

Note, the same password will be applied if you have multiple binds, or ldap servers, or file shares coonfigured.  

**Migration Summary:**

* To get details on how many items were created/updated or failed to migrate type âŒ˜S, or select Show Summary under the File menu.
  
  ![alt text](./jamf-migrator/images/summary1.png "Summary")
   
* Additional information about each count can be obtained by clicking on the number. For example, if we want to see a list of the 28 failed scripts, click on the 28.
  
  ![alt text](./jamf-migrator/images/summary2.png "Summary Details")
  
  
Information about successes/failures can be found in the log, located in 

```
~/Library/Containers/com.jamf.jamf-migrator/Data/Library/Logs/jamf-migrator/<date>_<time>_migration.log
```

If you have used jamf-migrator and saved passwords you will see the following after launching a new version.

 ![alt text](./jamf-migrator/images/allowAccess.png "Allow Keychain Access")
 
 If you'd like the new version to access existing credentials select the desired option.



**Important:**

* There are many dependencies between items, if they are not met transfers fail.  For example, if a policy is site specific the site must be migrated before the policy; if a distribution point has a building and/or department defined those need to migrate first...  If everything is migrated the order of sections is already taken care of, if you choose not to move some items that's where you can have issues.
* Summary window doesn't seem to be the most responsive.  May need to click the window or give the cursor some extra motion before the detailed summary appears.


**Note:** the app can also be used to clear out a Jamf server.  Typing the following after launching the app will set it into removal mode.  Items from the destination server are deleted once Go is clicked.

```
touch ~/Library/Containers/com.jamf.jamf-migrator/Data/Library/Application\ Support/jamf-migrator/delete
```

* You can also toggle the mode using &#8984;D or select Toggle Mode from View in the menu bar.

**v2.7.2**<br>
* Corrected encoding issue (#17) of special characters that caused authentication failures.

**v2.6.3**<br>
* Corrected an issued with self service icons not migrating if the icon name contained a space.

**v2.6.2**<br>
* Resolve issue #14, items not migrating in the proper order.

* Added the ability to migrate Jamf server accounts (users and groups).  Newly created accounts on the destination server will be created without a password (can't migrate passwords).  The account being used to authenticate to the destination server is not migrated if it also exists on the source server.  The migration of accounts depends on the existence of related sites and LDAP servers in order to be successful.
