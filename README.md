Migrate items from one Jamf server, or XML file(s), to another.  If an item (based on name) within a category exists on both source and destination, the destination item will be updated with values from the source server.

  Groups, Policies, and Configuration Profiles can be targeted to a particular site.

Feedback in the GUI gives a simplistic overview of the success of a transfer:
* Green - everything transferred.
* Yellow - some items transferred.
* Red - nothing transferred.
* White - nothing to transfer.


**Limitations/requirements to be aware of:**
* Passwords can not be extracted through the API which impacts migrating distribution points, computer management account, account used for LDAP - credentials must be reset on the destination server.
* Icons associated with Mac App Store apps are not migrated (can't be migrated).
* Only AFP and SMB shares can be migrated.
* Patch management is not available through the API impacting smart groups dependent on patch management extension attributes.
* Buildings - the API only allows the name to be migrated.
* If endpoints (computers, policies, configuration profiles...) have duplicate names on the source server issues will arise if the app is used to update those items from the source to destination server.  As each item is migrited it will overwrite the previous item with the same name.
* Migrating smart/static groups with criteria containing groups will fail if the parent group tries to migrate before the group in the criteria.  Migrating groups several times should allow all the nested groups to migrate before the parent group.
* Institutional disk encryptions that contain the private key cannot be migrated.
* Approved Kernel Extension payloads that contain bundle IDs will be dropped from the Configuration Profile.
* Approved Kernel Extension - the display name for the Approved Team ID does not migrate.

 
The 'Selective' tab provides the ability to select a subset of items within a category.  For example you might only want to transfer 4 new scripts from a larger pool of existing scripts.

Note: Policies are listed along with the their ID.  They'll be listed with a format of: policy name (ID)

Also, policies may have their dependencies checked/migrated using the Migrate Dependencies button.  Only 'top-level' dependencies are checked.  i.e. if the scope is being migrated and contains nested computer groups or groups assigned to a site that doesn't exist on the destination server the policy migration will likely fail.  Adding smart migrations is planned for other items.

When importing XML files they must be organized into folders that, for the most part, mirror their respective API nodes. i.e. computer XML files in a folder labeled computers, mobile devices in a folder called mobiledevices. Exceptions to this are group items, for example computer groups are split into a smartcomputergroups folder and staticcomputergroups folder. This is also how jamf-migrator exports files. Then when importing, select the folder that contains the API nodes we wish to update. For example, if selecting files generated by exporting data with jamf-migrator we would select the folder called raw.

**Important:** Trimmed XML files cannot be used as they are missing data required for the migration. 

**Preferences:**
* macOS Configuration Profiles 
* macOS Applications 
* Restrictions 
* Policies 
* Mobile Device Configuration Profiles 
* Mobile Device Applications 
* Static Computer Groups 
* Static Mobile Device Groups 
* Static User Groups 

In addition, Policies can be copied in a disabled state.

Options to export XML from the source server are also available.

![](https://github.com/jamfprofessionalservices/JamfMigrator/blob/master/jamf-migrator/images/export_migrator_prefs.png)
* Raw Source XML gives you the XML from the source server before any modifications, like removing the id tag(s) and value(s).
* Trimmed Source XML give you the XML that is sent to the destination server.
* Save only saves the XML files and does not send them to the destination server.
* Save the object XML either with or without its scope.  Unchecked removes the scope.
* Note Save only and Raw Source XML options should not be selected when File Import is being used.

Options for migrating object(s) (groups, policies, and configuration profiles) to a particular site can be set.

![](https://github.com/jamfprofessionalservices/JamfMigrator/blob/master/jamf-migrator/images/migrator2.5c.png)
* When copying an object to a site, the site name is appended to the object name.
* Groups with groups as a criteria will not copy properly, moving them should be fine.

**Migration Summary:**

* To get details on how many items were created/updated or failed to migrate type ⌘S, or select Show Summary under the File menu.
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/jamfprofessionalservices/JamfMigrator/blob/master/jamf-migrator/images/summary1.png "Summary")
   
* Additional information about each count can be obtained by clicking on the number. For example, if we want to see a list of the 28 failed scripts, click on the 28.
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/jamfprofessionalservices/JamfMigrator/blob/master/jamf-migrator/images/summary2.png "Summary Details")
  
  
Information about successes/failures can be found in the log, located in 

```
~/Library/Containers/com.jamf.jamf-migrator/Data/Library/Logs/jamf-migrator/<date>_<time>_migration.log
```

If you have used jamf-migrator and saved passwords you will see the following after launching a new version. 
 ![alt text](https://github.com/jamfprofessionalservices/JamfMigrator/blob/master/jamf-migrator/images/allowAccess.png "Allow Keychain Access")
 
 If you'd like the new version to access existing credentials select the desired option.



**Important:**

* There are many dependencies between items, if they are not met transfers fail.  For example, if a policy is site specific the site must be migrated before the policy; if a distribution point has a building and/or department defined those need to migrate first...  If everything is migrated the order of sections is already taken care of, if you choose not to move some items that's where you can have issues.
* Summary window doesn't seem to be the most responsive.  May need to click the window or give the cursor some extra motion before the detailed summary appears.


**Note:** the app can also be used to clear out a Jamf server.  Typing the following after launching the app will set it into removal mode.  Items from the destination server are deleted once Go is clicked.

```
touch ~/Library/Containers/com.jamf.jamf-migrator/Data/Library/Application\ Support/jamf-migrator/delete
```

* You can also toggle the mode using &#8984;D.

* Updated help.
* Better handleing in bringing the preferences window to the foreground when it is already open, but behind another window.

**v5.1.0**

* Addressed several issues around GET and POST counters, including issues #43 and #48.

**v5.0.0**

* Introduce smart selective migrations for policies.  When migrating a policy dependent items (scripts, packages, printers, computer groups, ...) will also be migrated/updated, if desired.  Only 'top-level' dependencies are checked.  i.e. if the scope of a policy is being migrated and contains nested computer groups or groups assigned to a site that doesn't exist on the destination server the policy migration will likely fail.

* Migration of icons used in self service for newly created policies. Updating an existing policy will not update the existing icon on the destination server.

**v2.2.5**

* Added migration of computer configurations.  Note, it is possible to delete the parent of a smart configuration, thus orphaning the 'child' config.  An orphaned child configuration is not accessible through the API, as a result it cannot be migrated.  In the event the orphaned child configuration(s) also has child configuration(s), those child configuration(s) are turned into parent configuration(s).

**v2.1.0**

* Added the ability to migrate Jamf server accounts (users and groups).  Newly created accounts on the destination server will be created without a password (can't migrate passwords).  The account being used to authenticate to the destination server is not migrated if it also exists on the source server.  The migration of accounts depends on the existence of related sites and LDAP servers in order to be successful.
