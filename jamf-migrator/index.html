<div>Migrate items from one Jamf server, or XML file(s), to another.  If an item (based on name) within a category exists on both source and destination, the destination item will be updated with values from the source server.</div>

    <div>About site operations:
<ul>
    <li id="body_li">When copying an object the site name is appended to the existing object name.</li>
    <li id="body_li">Dependencies must still be met.  ex. Work with groups before policies that depend on the groups.</li>
    <li id="body_li">Groups with groups as a criteria will not copy properly, moving them should be fine.</li>

</ul>
        </div>
    <hr/>
<div><br></div>
<div>Feedback in the GUI gives a simplistic overview of the success of a transfer:</div>
<ul>
   <li id="body_li">Green - everything transferred.</li>
   <li id="body_li">Yellow - some items transferred.</li>
   <li id="body_li">Red - nothing transferred.</li>
   <li id="body_li">White - nothing to transfer.</li>
   <br>
   You may see a difference between the color of the text and the progress bar.  This is an indication some dependency was missing.  For example a script migrated but the category it was associated with on the source server is missing on the destination server.

<div id="main_body" style="position:relative;">
<div style="font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:#000000;">
<div>Limitations/requirements to be aware of:</div>
<ul style="margin-left:17px;">
    <li>Passwords can not be extracted through the API which impacts migrating distribution points, computer management account, LDAP Servers, Jamf Users - credentials must be reset on the destination server.</li>
    <li>Policies with the Accounts payload will migrate with <strong>a new password assigned</strong> to the user defined within the payload.  The password being <strong>jamfchangeme</strong>.</li>
    <li>Icons associated with Mac App Store apps are not migrated (can't be migrated).</li>
    <li>Only AFP and SMB shares can be migrated.</li>
    <li>Patch management is not available through the API impacting smart groups dependent on patch management extension attributes.</li>
    <li>If endpoints (computers, policies, configuration profiles...) have duplicate names on the source server issues will arise if the app is used to update or migrate those items from the source to destination server.  When migrating only the last item migrated will appear as each one migrates it will overwrite (update) any existing item with the same name.</li>
    <li>Migrating smart/static groups with criteria containing groups will fail if the parent group tries to migrate before the group in the criteria.  Migrating groups several times should allow all the nested groups to migrate before the parent group.</li>
    <li>Institutional disk encryptions that contain the private key cannot be migrated.</li>
    <li>Approved Kernel Extension payloads do not migrate properly.  Display nanes are dropped and additional keys/values are added by the Jamf API that results in a failure in profile deployment.</li>
    <li>Policies - The Software Update payload does not migrate.  Also, within the packages payload, setting for the distribution point will not migrate.</li>
    <li>Objects with trailing spaces in the name will migrate once but the process of uploading through the API removes those spaces.  This causes issues re-migrating those objects as the names no longer match.</li>
    <li>Users and usergroups used in policy limitations/exclusions do not migrate as the API does not provide that information.</li>
    <li>Only package metadata (display name, file name, size, ...) is migrated.  To migrate the actual package either use your browser, Jamf Admin, or [jamfcpr](https://github.com/BIG-RAT/jamfcpr)</li>
    <li>The API allows for the creation of multiple packages, with different display names, to reference the same package file name.  The Jamf Pro console prevents this as there should be a one to one mapping.</li>
    <li>Saving of objects whos name contains a : (colon) will be saved using a ; (semi-colon).</li>
    <li>Enabled state of mobile device applications is not handled in the API, as a result all migrated mobile device applications will be enabled on the destination server whether it is enabled or disabled on the source.</li>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<div>The 'Selective' tab provides the ability to select a subset of items within a category.&nbsp; For example you might only want to transfer 3 new scripts from a larger pool of existing scripts.</div>

<div>Note: Policies are listed along with the their ID.&nbsp; You'll see something like: policy name (ID)</div>
<div>Also, policies may have their dependencies check/migrated using the Migrate Dependencies button.  Only 'top-level' dependencies are checked.  i.e. if the scope is being migrated and contains nested computer groups or groups assigned to a site that doesn't exist on the destination server the policy migration will likely fail.  Adding smart migrations is planned for other items.</div>

<div>When importing XML files they must be organized into folders that, for the most part, mirror their respective API nodes.  i.e. computer XML files in a folder labeled computers, mobile devices in a folder called mobiledevices.  Exceptions to this are group items, for example computer groups are split into a smartcomputergroups folder and staticcomputergroups folder.  This is also how jamf-migrator exports files.  Then when importing, select the folder that contains the API nodes we with to update.  For example, if selecting files generated by exporting data with jamf-migrator we would select the folder called raw.</div>
<div id="app_image" style="position:relative;width:440px">
    <img src="images/open.png" alt=""><br><br>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Trimmed XML files cannot be used as they are missing data required for the migration.
</div>

<strong>Preferences:</strong>
<div>You can modify how some items are copied.  The following items can be copied without any scope defined, leaving the existing scope on the destination server unchanged (if the item exists there already).
    <ul style="margin-left:17px;">
        <li>macOS Configuration Profiles</li>
        <li>macOS Applications</li>
        <li>Restrictions</li>
        <li>Policies</li>

        <li>Static Computer Groups</li>
        <li>Static Mobile Device Groups</li>
        <li>Static User Groups</li>
    </ul>
    In addition, Policies can be copied in a disabled state.</div>
<div>
    <img src="images/copyPrefs.png" alt="" style="position:relative; left: 100px; width:360px">
</div>
<div>Options to export XML from the source server are also available.</div>
<div>
    <img src="images/exportPrefs.png" alt="" style="position:relative; left: 100px; width:360px">
</div>
<ul style="margin-left:17px;">
   <li>Raw Source XML gives you the XML from the source server before any modifications, like removing the id tag(s) and value(s).</li>
   <li>Trimmed Source XML give you the XML that is sent to the destination server.</li>
   <li>Save only saves the XML files and does not send them to the destination server.</li>
   <li>Save the object XML either with or without its scope.  Unchecked removes the scope.</li>
   <li>Note: Neither Raw Source XML nor Save Only should be selected when File Import is selected.</li>
</ul>
<div>By default files are saved to ~/Downloads/Jamf Migrator/, this can be changed.  Within the Jamf Migrator folder (or whatever folder you've selected) a folder called raw and or trimmed will be created to store the objects.  They will be saved with a folder named after the API endpoint they were exported from.  The name of an individual file is formated as &lt;name&gt;-&lt;id&gt;.xml.</div>

If you have used jamf-migrator and saved passwords you will see the following after launching a new version.
<div style="position:relative; left: 30px; width:420px">
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <img src="images/allowAccess.png" alt="">
    </ul>
</div>
<div>If you'd like the new version to access existing credentials select the desired option.<br><br></div>
<div>
    <strong>Important:</strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
       <li>There are many dependencies (<a class="body_a" href="#dependencies">view here</a>) between items, if they are not met, transfers fail.&nbsp; For example, if a policy is site specific the site must be migrated before the policy; if a script is assigned to a category the category must be migrated first....&nbsp; If everything is migrated the order of sections is already taken care of, if you choose not to move some items that's where you can have issues.</li>
       <li><br></li>
       <li>As a result it is best to start migrating items under the 'General' tab first.&nbsp; Items under macOS and iOS typically have some dependency on categories, network segments, sites...</li>
       <li><br></li>
       <li><br></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <strong>Logging:</strong>
    <ul>
       <li>Basic log information is written to the following folder: <span style="font-family:'Courier New';">~/Library/Containers/com.jamf.jamf-migrator/Data/Library/Logs/jamf-migrator/</span>.  The log directory can easily be accessed by typing &#8984;L or select Show Logs under View in the menu bar.</li>
       <li>More detailed logging can be captured by launching the application through Terminal using the '-debug' switch.&nbsp; If the application is located in /Applications:</li>
        <span style="margin-left:28px;line-height:31px; font-family:'Courier New';">/Applications/jamf-migrator.app/Contents/MacOS/jamf-migrator -debug</span>
    </ul>
    <br><br><hr><br>

    <ul style="text-align: center; list-style-type: none;">
       <li><span style="font-size:27px;line-height:31px;color:#FF0000;"><strong>Danger, Danger, Danger</strong></span></li>
    </ul>

</div>
<div>The application may also be used to clear information from a server.&nbsp; To place the application in removal mode run the following command in Terminal <strong>after</strong> the application has been launched:</div>
<ul style="margin-left:28px; list-style-type: none;">
   <li><span style="font-family:'Courier New';">touch ~/Library/Containers/com.jamf.jamf-migrator/Data/Library/Application\ Support/jamf-migrator/delete</span></li>
</ul>
<div>You can also toggle the mode by selecting View --> Toggle Mode from the menu bar, or using &#8984;D.</div>
<div>The application will alert you that data will be removed by displaying -- Removing -- rather than Migrate.&nbsp; Data is removed from the destination server.&nbsp; Once you hit 'Go!' items will get removed and once the process finishes the 'delete' file is removed and the application is back in migration mode.</div>
<div>Note, source server credentials are not required (and are ignored) when removing items from the destination server.  Also, dependencies play a role in deletions/removals as they do with migrations.&nbsp; For example, a site can not be deleted if it contains, say, users and users can't be deleted if they are associated with a device.</div>
    
<div id="app_image" style="position:relative;width:800px">
    <img src="images/migrator4.png" id="Image4" alt="">
</div>
<div>When using the Selective tab while doing removals, the list of available objects is greyed out once all the selected items have been removed.  If you wish to remove additional items either touch the 'delete' file or hit &#8984;D, the list will be re-enabled.</div>
</div>
    
<div id="app_image" style="position:relative;width:800px">
<img src="images/migrator4.1.png" id="Image4.1" alt=""></div>
    
<div id="main_body" style="position:relative;">
    <div style="font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:#000000;">
        You can export object XML data before deleting it by selecting raw source XML from the export preferences.  Be aware some data, in particular security related data, like passwords for distribution points or passwords for LDAP connections, will not be exported.  However passwords used in configuration profiles, WiFi passwords for example, will  be exported and be displayed in plain text within the XML file.

        <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
        <div>
            Running the following in Terminal will export all objects (full XML) that can be migrated:
            <ul style="margin-left:28px; list-style-type: none;">
                <li><span style="font-family:'Courier New';">/path/to/jamf-migrator.app/Contents/MacOS/jamf-migrator -source your.jamfPro.fqdn -export -objects allobjects</span></li>
            </ul>
            Before running an export via command line at least one export from the app must be manually run saving the source username and password.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            To migrate object(s) using the command line, something like the following can be used:
            <ul style="margin-left:28px; list-style-type: none;">
                <li><span style="font-family:'Courier New';">/path/to/jamf-migrator.app/Contents/MacOS/jamf-migrator -source your.jamfPro.fqdn -destination dest.jamfPro.fqdn -objects categories,buildings -migrate</span></li>
            </ul>
            If importing files, the import folder must be selected in the UI before the command line can be successfully run.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            To set an ldap id of 3 on jamf user accounts and force that id (also converts local accounts to ldap) use the following:
            <ul style="margin-left:28px; list-style-type: none;">
                <li><span style="font-family:'Courier New';">/path/to/jamf-migrator.app/Contents/MacOS/jamf-migrator -ldapid 3 -forceldapid true</span></li>
            </ul>
            This can also be accomplished using the UI by launching jamf-migrator from Terminal:
            <ul style="margin-left:28px; list-style-type: none;">
                <li><span style="font-family:'Courier New';">/path/to/jamf-migrator.app/Contents/MacOS/jamf-migrator -ldapid 3 -forceldapid true</span></li>
